# Cronduino

Cronduino is an Arduino based Hardware Scheduler. It has a realtime clock for accurate timing, and the Arduino Internal EEPROM is used for storage of schedule. The scheduling mechanism used is the same as the one used for Linux based CRON. In addition, an LCD is attached to see the current time. The timing schedule is stored to the Arduino by moving a text file directly to the Arduino.

Not all of CRON spec is implemented in this project due to the limitations inherent to the Arduino Architecture.
